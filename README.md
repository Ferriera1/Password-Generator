# Password-Generator
Added some comments in the javascript to remind me of what the provided code is doing.
created a generate password function because the given code has a writePassword function that initializes a variable password that has a value of generatePassword() but was never used.
added in my variable criteria
added if statements for my different criteria and the prompts for yes or no
added a while statement to iterate through the allCriteria variable until password length is met
